# Hoodoo-Assignment1-
1)Hoodoo assignment contains a website which is coded by using HTML5,CSS3,Javascript,Real API'S and Bootstrap4.
 2)Here in index.html file i had taken all the images and links online so need to download any of the images.
 3)If you want to run the whole whole code  please make a separate folder and place both the file index.html and script.js in same folder.After that with the help of any editor you can run both the files.
4) Note that I use the API which is available for free from goggle console so i case if you are not getting the location output just enter your own key in the api link section and than you may run the code without any error.
5)If you purchase the api location key from goggle you will not get any error
6)screenshot of the final output is also given in the form of image
